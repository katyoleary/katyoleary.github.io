      <p> Our team here in the Galapagos Islands is dedicated to assisting Mermaids in Distress. Our team of fifteen amazingly dedicated individuals put their lives on the line multiple times a month on our Search and Rescue Missions. Mermaids due to the rising ocean temperatures often become disoriented, get caught in human fishing nets or injured by our watercraft. With caring and aware people like you donating we can work at our highest capacity. We are also in the works to building a state of the art Rehabiliation Center located on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernandina_Island">Fernandina Island!</a>
